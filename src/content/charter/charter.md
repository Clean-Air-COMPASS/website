# Clean Air COMPASS Charter

## Introduction

The Clean Air Fund has selected NRDC, Sonoma Technology, and OpenAQ to lead the creation of an open-source data management system (DMS) for air quality data. Creation of the DMS will be driven and informed by a global, stakeholder-driven network called COMPASS (Community of Practice for Air Quality Systems). The COMPASS network will consist of a committed group of core partners with established credibility and track-records in the field of air quality, data, and equity, and will seek input and be informed by additional stakeholders and thought-partners. The DMS will be open-source, flexible, and purpose-built to meet the needs of capacity-constrained entities such as community organizations, low to middle income countries and cities, and academic partners in need of a data management solution for their air quality data.

## Vision

A robust international network of participating entities with a shared ambition to support environmental monitoring efforts that drive on the ground improvements to environmental conditions, especially for communities overburdened by and acutely vulnerable to environmental pollution.

## Goal

Create an open-source DMS custom-built for the needs of capacity-constrained entities such as community organizations, low- to middle-income countries and cities, and academic institutions that are pursuing air quality monitoring. The DMS will be open-source, customizable, and scaled to match the needs and capacity constraints of the above entity types. The DMS will be designed around the feedback and direction provided by COMPASS.

In addition to development of the DMS, we hope that COMPASS will be an ongoing formal network of organizations with a shared interest in improving air quality and other environmental conditions through support of environmental monitoring, data equity and transparency, and the just and fair use of environmental information. If desired by COMPASS, we will seek funding for further joint activities of interest.

## Values

BUILD TRUST  
Work in a spirit of collaboration that honors the input and commitment of each participating entity and move at the speed of building trust across the community of practice.

BE INCLUSIVE  
Understand and appreciate that a global community of varied entity types will represent many different perspectives, realities, norms, and needs. Approach colleagues in a spirit of open-mindedness, understanding, and mutual support to hear, listen, and engage one another.

TRANSPARENCY  
Share information and engage in a spirit of transparency. Be upfront with colleagues within the community of practice about limitations and potential conflicts.

SPEAK FOR YOUR CONSTITUENCY  
The community of practice represents a variety of stakeholders with different perspectives. Members will strive to clearly represent the perspective of their constituency and not speak on behalf of constituencies, such as communities, that they do not represent.

TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION  
Community of practice members will be aware of the audience and scientific terminology being utilized. Members will ensure technical expertise is understood and will check in for difficulties with language or cultural barriers.

COMMITTED TO OPEN-SOURCE  
“Open-source”[^1] is defined as the source code for the software being freely available and redistributable, with no commercial strings attached. To ensure anyone can modify the open-source DMS to their needs, the source code will remain open and free, but COMPASS will discuss how to fund ongoing development and maintenance of the source code, licensing aspects, and whether ongoing external code contributions will be invited.

[^1]: “Open-source” does not imply “open data.” The open-source DMS will facilitate data sharing, but will not require that data be shared publicly.
