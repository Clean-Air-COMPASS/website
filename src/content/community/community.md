The projectâ€™s direction is guided by a community of practice (COMPASS), a network of core partners representing different geographies and data expertise with established credibility to secure the stakeholder feedback needed to build an open-source Data Management System (DMS) that will meet the needs of a wide range of organizations that are monitoring air quality.

Core COMPASS members include: Allin-Wayra, Clean Air Asia, Environmental
Compliance Institute (ECI), Science and Community Action Network (SciCAN), and
Youth Group on Protection of the Environment (YGPE).
