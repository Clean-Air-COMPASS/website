title: Project origin

---


The project emerged from a critical global need: effective air quality data management. Existing data management systems are falling short as monitoring efforts by governments, community-based organizations and other institutions are increasing.Proprietary or custom-built solutions can be costly, opaque, and inefficient, wasting resources and hindering action. This initiative directly addresses these pain points by offering a customizable open-source Data Management System (DMS), born from global feedback to meet expressed needs.
